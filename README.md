# About this project

This is a personal project that came from A-Level computer science NEA that I wanted to develop more and create a web version and android version for. This is going to be a long term personal project due to me being as of yet the only developer.


## Roadmap
### IOS
- [ ] Temp
### WEB
- [ ] Yet to be implimented
### Android
- [ ] Yet to be implimented
## Appendix

The app for IOS isnt published yet due to costs and being a solo developer on this I can't guarantee it ever will, however I have plans to make a android version and a web version that should be usuable
